*   PROGRAM TO WRITE. IN EACH COBOL PROGRAM WHICH IS IN ALL COMPUTERS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS YOU SEE, YOU ADDRESS EVERYTHING.
* WE NEED TO HAVE A COBOL PROGRAM MUCH LIKE IIN THE PROCESSORS THAT CAN BE UPDATED TO USE ALL RAM ON COMPUTER. THERE IS A 
*LOT OF MATH AND THE PROGRAM NEEDS A LITTLE BITE OF AI TOUCH AND A FILE THAT ASSIGNS BASED ON ASKING THE COMPUTER HOW MUCH 
*RAM IT HAS AND THEN THE MATH FORMULA WE COME UP WITH WILL DISTRIBUTE OUT TO USE ALL RAM AND NOT JUST US ASSIGNING SECTIONS. 
*bASICALLY THIS PROGRAM MATHEMATICALLY FINDS THE RAM AMOUNT AND HAS CALCULATING ABILITY TO HAND IT OUT TO THE PROGRAMS AND RUN 
*FASTER WITH LES CLUTTER AND POWER.
